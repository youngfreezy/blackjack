//objectives
//create logic for the stand button
  //show the dealers card
  //calculate dealer score
  //the dealer will continue to hit until he has a total of 17 or more
      //we'll assume that both ace cases must be equal to or over 17
  //if player is over 21 he loses
  //if dealer 21 he loses
  //else the person with the higher score wins
  //if they both have the same score tie
  
//create logic for hit - if over 21 dealer wins



//Your goals

// Bare minimum requirements:

// Use the command described above to compile your coffeescript into javascript
// Implement the core BlackJack rules (details in the next section)
// Write unit tests that prove that your game implements those rules
// Pick two or more of the following ways to make your game better
// Make the user experience better (e.g. make things look nicer, introduce a 
  // delay when dealing/revealing cards)
// Give the user casino chips and allow them to bet and win (or lose!)
// Implement the full rules (allow the user to split or double, you 
  // can look those rules up online)
// Use the same shuffled stack of one or more decks across rounds, 
// giving people that can count cards an advantage ;)
